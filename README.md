# JavaScript Adventure (Text-Based Logic Variant)

**Research Project Presented at the MIT AI & Education Summit 2025**

This repository contains the source code for the "Text-Based" variant of the **JavaScript Adventure** educational platform. This project was developed as part of my research titled *"Expanding Access to Computer Science Education Through AI Generated Lessons, Quizzes and Coding Challenges,"* which I presented at the **MIT AI & Education Summit 2025**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **JavaScript Adventure** is an AI-generated, web-based platform designed to teach fundamental JavaScript concepts to students with little to no coding experience.

Unlike traditional AI-tutor models, this project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to **generate the curriculum and site functionality** beforehand, rather than acting as a real-time chatbot. This design choice intentionally positions AI as a "curriculum development tool" for teachers rather than a crutch for students, aiming to mitigate the risk of student deskilling and over-reliance on generative AI.

### 🔬 Research Context & A/B Testing
This specific repository houses the **Text-Based Logic** version of the platform.

In my research, I investigated how different types of coding challenges impact student engagement and learning outcomes. While the primary version of the platform utilized graphical, physics-based simulations (e.g., "bouncing balls"), this version was built with **simplified text-based challenges**.

This allowed for comparative analysis (A/B testing) to determine if high-fidelity visual simulations provide a meaningful difference in educational value compared to purely logic-based text challenges.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Scaffolded Learning Flow:** Each unit follows a proven pedagogical structure:
    1.  **Lesson:** Text-based explanation of a concept (e.g., Functions, Loops) with video references.
    2.  **Quiz:** Multiple-choice assessment to check comprehension before proceeding.
    3.  **Coding Challenge:** A hands-on coding task where students apply the concept to solve a problem.
* **AI-Generated Curriculum:** All lessons, quiz questions, and challenge prompts were generated using LLMs, demonstrating a scalable pipeline for educational content creation.
* **Curriculum Coverage:** Covers six foundational concepts: Functions, Variables, If/Else Statements, For Loops, Arrays, and Objects.
* **Self-Directed:** Designed for independent learning, allowing students to progress without direct instructor supervision.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Content Generation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) used for prompting and code generation

## 📊 Research Outcomes

The broader research study involved 27 users and demonstrated promising results regarding the scalability of AI-generated tools.

* **Independence:** 89% of users completed the work on their own without instructor intervention.
* **Engagement:** The platform achieved a 64% completion rate across all six units, a significant metric for a self-directed tool.
* **Accessibility:** Beginners with no prior coding experience were able to complete the curriculum at high rates (75%).
